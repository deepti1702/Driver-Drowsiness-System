# Driver-Drowsiness-System
The facial drowsiness detection system is responsible for collecting data from live video input. It utilizes a camera to capture real-time footage of the driver's face. This data is then processed using a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm, which is a popular machine learning technique used for detecting objects. The algorithm extracts various components of the from the video, such as the measure the driver's eye aspect ratio (EAR), mouth aspect ratio (MAR), and head tilt position. These measurements serve as indicators of drowsiness. By analysing this data, the system is able to determine the driver's level of alertness. If signs of drowsiness are detected, the system activates a buzzer to alert the driver.
